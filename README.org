* dmenu-terminal
  Allows you to open a terminal app using [[http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]].
** Setting it up
   Put =dmenu-terminal= somewhere on your =$PATH=.
** Hooking it up to XMonad
  It's easy to run this from xmonad, here's how I do it:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
import XMonad
import XMonad.Util.EZConfig

main = xmonad $ defaultConfig
        `additionalKeysP`
        [ ("M-b" , spawn "$HOME/bin/dmenu-terminal") ]
#+END_SRC

   This is loosely based off of [[https://github.com/losingkeys/dmenu-web][dmenu-web]]
